\chapter{Versioning}
\label{chap:versioning}

Versioning determines the creation and management of releases of a product. The product carries the main logic of the application and a version is created when a modification or customization is needed. This means that consumers use the same product but they can use its different version. The version could have been released because of new requirements or due to an improvement of funcionality. 

\section{Versioning of services}
\label{sec:verioningservices}
Thanks to versioning, services can be evolved and customized. When a breaking change of service occurs, the new version can be created so that the existing consumers of services are not affected. Release of a new version doesn't harm the previous one, all versions can coexist and be used at the same time. Each version has its own implementation and is distinguishably addressed.

The breaking change can be for example a new requirement from one of the consumers, the new version is released and the consumer can immediately switch to use it. Other consumers can follow their schedule and switch to the newest version when it is suitable for them.

The implemenation of services requires the proper definition of following concepts ( 3 = msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb491124.aspx):
%what will be versioned and how, the life-cycle of the versions and the access to the version.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Units of versioning
  \item Service changes, constituting a new version
  \item Service version life-cycle considerations
  \item Version deployment/access approaches
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Units of versioning}
It is needed to define what will be versioned, the most frequent are two possibilities:

\begin{description}
  \item[Versioning of the service] 
  The whole service is versioned with all its methods. This approach is working well with the object-oriented and the component-base development. It's not appropriate with coarse-grained services.(3)
  \item[Versioning of the service method] 
  In most cases the change arises just in a method or some methods of the service. It is not neccessary to version the whole service, but there is an option to verison just these operations.
  The benefits of this approach are less code which is deployed because just a changed methods are redeployed in a new version. All services are immutable, their name and classification remain unchanged when there is a method added. The changes concern just a consumers which use the method, instead of consumers of the service containing changed method. 
  When the versioning of method is used it is needed to deploy each method with its own endpoint address, the advantage is that the SLA (Service-layer agreement) is provided fot the method so that it is not changed the SLA of the same service.
  Moreover the addressing schema becomes more complex, the consumer has to specify not just the service but also the method and version of method which wants to use.
In spite of the more elaborate routing this possibility of versioning offers more flexibility. It adapts the services versioning to versioning practices of commonly used programming languages. 
Other benefit of this approach is deprecation, an old method which has new vesion can be signed as deprecated. The method can become deprecated when a better alternative is implemented but there are still consumers which use the old one. This method can remain in service until all consumers switch to the newest method.
\end{description}

\subsection{Version definition}
It is necessary to analyze the services/methods from the point of view of changes, their impact on the consumer. Analysis of possible changes deals with influence of change on the consumers execution and consequntly defines the changes which will break it. When the change of the service or method is breaking it leads to the creation of new version.

The components of the service are interface and message, both of them could be changed and cause the release of new version.

\subsubsection{Interface changes}
A change of interface has significant impact on the consumer, it requires many modification of customers implementation or even completely new service. The deprecation of a method is equivalent to its removal and should occur rarely.
When following semantic messages model, the interface is never changed. Advatage of this approach has source in the fact that all changes can be done just within the methods of service. When the methods are units of versioning they are deployed individually and new methods can be added without any impact on existing consumer. When the method is going to be removed, it is first deprecated, so that is still kept around the service and could be used until all consumers stop to use it. The changes are contained in messages and are not shown whitin the interface.
Than as seen it is better to desing the versioning defintion in order to not include the interface changes.

\subsubsection{Message changes}
When using the semantic message model the changes of service interface do not change the interfac itelf but are contained in message. The message is created by a schema which describes its content. Chenges in schema can provide different cases of compatibility wit actial implementation and can be divided in three categories:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Revisions
  Revisions are changes without semantic content, for exapmle formatting, comments, etc. They do not affect the functionality of the service and service consumers.
  
  \item Minor changes
  Minor changes are backward-compatible changes of document schema, that means the changes do not impact consumers, the new version continue to support the consumers working with the old version. Examples can be new optional element to existing type, a change of optionality of a local element from required ot optional, adding global type or global element, etc.
  
  \item Major changes
  Major changes are non-backward compatible changes, after a major change the new document schema is no longer compatible with the old one. These chagnes are breaking the usage of the service by the consumer. They are imposed to the new version and consumers need to adjust its program to switch to this version. Breaking changes can be performed by adding or removing an enumeration, removing or renaming a global type or element, changing the optionality of an element from optional to required.
\end{enumerate} 

\subsubsection{Implementation changes}
Interface defines the serivce and make the access point from the consumer point of view. The underlying implementation is encapsulated and not visible for outer world. Depite this the implementation cannot be replaced without affectiong the whole service. A provider of service has the contract including SLA \ref{sec:sla} with a service consumer. The contract has to be followed because it is valid document on which the consumer relies. 
Every change which has to be done in the implementation of the service needs to be validated against the contract. When the implementation which is going to be replaced is the breaking change from the point of view of the consumer the agreement with the change of contract is needed and consequently the new version has to be released.

\subsection{Service version life-cycle}
Service life-cycle defines the time period in which a version should be maintained. When the time is short, customers have not enough time for their upgrades required in order to swich on new verion.l On the other hand when the period is too long, too many versions of service have to be maintained. The suitable time span is a result of consideration of individual organization with respect to their capability to deal with changes.

\subsection{Version access}
It is needed to define how different consumers of services are accessing its verion of the service. There are several approachs everyone has its pros and cons. The access posibilities are described in separate chapter \ref{chap:versionaccess}.
