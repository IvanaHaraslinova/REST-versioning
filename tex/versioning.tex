Versioning determines the creation and management of releases of a product. The product carries the main logic of the application and a version is created when the customization is needed. It means that each client uses the same product and its concrete version which can differ according to the requirements of the customer or due the improvement of funcionality. 

\section{Versioning of services}
Thanks to versioning services can be evolved and customized. When a breaking change of service occurs, the new version can be created so that the existing customers, existing users of services are not broken. Release of new version doesn't harm the previous one and all versions can continue to be used.
